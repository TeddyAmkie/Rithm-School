### What is Big O notation and why does it matter?

Big O notation is a way to measure time complexity as well as space complexity. It's important because while it's not 100% accurate, it will give a good enough measure of how code will affect runtime. It can give a reference of how much time and space code wil end up taking for discussions and planning.

### What is time complexity?

 The amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. 

### What are some differences between arrays and objects?

 Arrays are ordered and every element has an index. Arrays have a length property. Objects have key:pair values. 

### What are some differences between `var` and `let`?

var variables can be redeclared, and does not create block scope whereas let variables cannot be redeclared and does create block scope.

### What are some differences between `let` and `const`?

let variables can be reassigned, but const variables cant be reassigned.

### What are some differences between arrow functions and the function keyword?

Arrows functions do not have a ".this" and return by default. Arrow functions are much shorter to type making it easier to read and use for short functions, but can lose readability when used for longer functions. 

### What is the purpose of the rest operator?

It will get an infinite number of arguments. It can be used when you don't know how many arguments there are.

### What is the purpose of the spread operator?

Can create a copy of an array/object without pointing to the same reference. 

### What is Object Oriented Programming?

A way of organizing code. By using Classes, it makes it much easier to plan and design code to have a clear and understandable flow. 

### What is a class? When would you make one?

A class is similar to an object and stores methods that can be reused by any new instances that inherit its properties.

### What is an instance?

An instance is a child of a Class, allowing it to inherit the methods of the parent. 

### What is the keyword `this`?

this is used in Classes to refer to the left of the previous .

### What does the `bind` function do?

bind allows us to return a function while keeping a saved context.
